[League\\Csv 8](https://github.com/thephpleague/csv/blob/8.0.0/CHANGELOG.md) has been officially released. This new major version requires at least `PHP 5.5` and its corresponding `HHVM` version. Dropping support for `PHP 5.4` makes the code significantly easier to maintain while enabling adding new functionalities. This version is focused on making the `Reader` class simpler as well as more flexible.

### What's new ?

This new version introduces two new extracting methods:

- `Reader::fetchPairs`
- `Reader::fetchPairsWithoutDuplicates`

{% gist a0807df54a29d1a89e48 fetchPairs-generator.php %}

With these additions, all basic retrieving methods that came to be expected from an extracting object are now available for you to use on any CSV document.

### What's changed ?

The `Reader` class [has been rewritten to allow better CSV processing](http://csv.thephpleague.com/reading/).

For that purpose methods that previously return `array`, namely, `Reader::fetchAssoc` and `Reader::fetchColumn` now return an `Iterator`. And their optional callable argument for are now easier to use by updating their parameter signature.

{% gist a0807df54a29d1a89e48 fetchAssoc-iterator.php %}

The query filter options used by the `Reader` class as well by the CSV conversion methods were reduced to those that where actually useful.

Because of inconsistencies between the `Zend Engine` and `HHVM`, the `SplFileObject` flags can no longer be set or modified.

Last but not least, small backward compatible breaks were introduced into the `BOM` API, to improve the methods return type consistencies.

### Upgrading to the new version

If you've only use the `Writer` class, then upgrading should be simple as no changes was made to the class public API. If, on the other hand, you've been using the `Reader` class like always:
