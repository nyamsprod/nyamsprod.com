A simple post to let everyone knows that Bakame.csv has become League\\Csv. Nothing has changed except for the fact that I had to move from a cool namespace (that most of you didn't understand anyway :)) to [another cool namespace](http://thephpleague.com/ "The League of Extraordinary Packages"). The library is still growing strong and I've added a number of new features in the meantime. So visit [the library dedicated website](http://csv.thephpleague.com/ "CSV data manipulation made easy in PHP") for a full documentation or [fork the Github repo to enhance the library](https://github.com/thephpleague/csv "League\Csv on Github")
