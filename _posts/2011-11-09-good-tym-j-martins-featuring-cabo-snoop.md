J Martins, the nigerian singer is back with a brand new album. And what better way to promote the futur release than to present a new clip featuring Cabo Snoop from Angola. What more can be said just that with another african collaboration and J Martins once again has found another major hit (following his collabo with Fally Ipupa).
