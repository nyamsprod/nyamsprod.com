A thumbs up to my boy from PlanB Multimedia with this underground project called Saligoma. This joint is called Ibereshi and is from Maylo. For those who don't understand Kinyarwanda Ibereshi it's a rwandan deformation of the word "Camp des Belges" which trough time and slang has become the word used to title this joint.
