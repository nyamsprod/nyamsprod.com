As a member of The PHP League I provide several open source packages.

- [League\Csv](https://csv.thephpleague.com/): is a simple library to ease CSV parsing, writing and filtering in PHP. The goal of the library is to be as powerful while remaining lightweight, by utilizing PHP native classes whenever possible.
- [League\Uri](https://uri.thephpleague.com): The library provides simple and intuitive classes to parse, validate and manipulate URIs and their components in PHP following RFC3986 and RFC3987
- [League\Period](https://period.thephpleague.com): is PHP&#8217;s missing Time Range class. It is based on [Resolving Feature Envy in the Domain](https://verraes.net/2014/08/resolving-feature-envy-in-the-domain/) by Mathias Verraes and extends the concept to cover all basic operations regarding time ranges.

I also maintain the following packages:

- [php-domain-parser](https://github.com/jeremykendall/php-domain-parser): This library ensures that you can parse a domain name against official resources like the IANA [Top Level Domain List](https://www.iana.org/domains/root/files) or Mozilla's [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/).
